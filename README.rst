Django EL(Endless) Pagination
=============================


Django EL(Endless) Pagination can be used to provide Twitter-style or
Digg-style pagination, with optional Ajax support and other features
like multiple or lazy pagination.

This app **django-el-pagination** forked from [django-el-pagination](https://github.com/shtalinberg/django-el-pagination)


This app **django-el-pagination** forked from django-endless-pagination==2.0 (https://github.com/frankban/django-endless-pagination)

From version 3.0.0 drop support Django<1.8. For support Django<1.8 use django-endless-pagination==2.x.x

From version 3.3.0 drop support Django<1.11. For support Django<1.11 use django-endless-pagination<3.3.x


The initial idea, which has guided the development of this application,
is to allow pagination of web contents in `very few steps
<http://django-el-pagination.readthedocs.org/en/latest/start.html>`_.
